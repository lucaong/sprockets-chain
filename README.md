# SprocketsChain

`SprocketsChain` is a small node.js utility that parses Sprockets require directives and returns the dependency chain
for a JavaScript bundle, which is a list of the file paths that make the bundle, ordered so that each file is preceded
by all its dependencies.

## Why

Sprockets is very nice for managing assets and their dependencies in a Ruby project. When testing JavaScript though,
precompiling and bundling assets is slow and not really needed. It is more efficient to just require the separate
JavaScript/CoffeeScript source files in the correct order. `SprocketsChain` parses the require directives and provides
you with the correct ordered list of absolute file paths. This helps setting up a JavaScript test suite that is fast and
completely independent from the Ruby application environment.

## Usage

```javascript
// karma.conf.js
var SprocketsChain = require("sprockets-chain");

var sc = new SprocketsChain();

// Append paths to the list of load paths
sc.appendPath("app/assets/javascripts");
sc.appendPath("lib/assets/javascripts");
sc.appendPath("vendor/assets/javascripts");

// If necessary, append extensions (defaults are ".js", ".coffee")
sc.appendExtensions(".ejs", ".eco");

// Get ordered array of individual absolute file paths that compose the
// `application.js` bundle
var chain = sc.depChain("application.js");
```

## Supported Sprockets directives

The following Sprockets directive are supported: `require`, `require_self`, `require_directory`, `require_tree`
and `include`
